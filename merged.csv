1253,Reconstruct a 2-Row Binary Matrix,"A matrix diagonal is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the bottom-right direction until reaching the matrix's end. For example, the matrix diagonal starting from mat[2][0], where mat is a 6 x 3 matrix, includes cells mat[2][0], mat[3][1], and mat[4][2]. Given an m x n matrix mat of integers, sort each matrix diagonal in ascending order and return the resulting matrix. ",./leetcode/solutions/python3/reconstruct-a-2-row-binary-matrix.py,True

1255,Maximum Score Words Formed by Letters,You are given an integer array nums. The value of this array is defined as the sum of |nums[i] - nums[i + 1]| for all 0 <= i < nums.length - 1. You are allowed to select any subarray of the given array and reverse it. You can perform this operation only once. Find maximum possible value of the final array. ,./leetcode/solutions/python3/maximum-score-words-formed-by-letters.py,True
1256,Encode Number,"Given an array of integers arr, replace each element with its rank. The rank represents how large the element is. The rank has the following rules: ",./leetcode/solutions/python3/encode-number.py,True
1257,Smallest Common Region,"Given an m x n matrix, return a new matrix answer where answer[row][col] is the rank of matrix[row][col]. The rank is an integer that represents how large an element is compared to other elements. It is calculated using the following rules: The test cases are generated so that answer is unique under the given rules. ",./leetcode/solutions/python3/smallest-common-region.py,True
